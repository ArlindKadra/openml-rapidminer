1.0.0
- First Release

1.0.1
- "TopK": Work around for wrong sorting direction in RM
 
1.0.2
- Added
 - Weights2Ranking
 - Selection2Ranking
 - LARS / LASSO
 - Fixed some issues with missing meta data
 - Eensemble FS now supports absolute weights

1.0.3
 - Rearranged resources
 - Changed the caching strategy of the MRMRCriteria.
   Now the user needs to create a MRMRCache-object in RM if he wants to use caching.
   There is no need for clearing the cache by hand.
   -> The MRMRCacheResetter was replaced by a MRMRCacheCreator
 - Renamed and rearranged operators in RM
 - Added some operator description

1.0.4
  - RFE: added parameter: use_absolute_weights
  - FIXED: Computation of F-test lacked ^2 in enumerator term. Affected all MRMR-operators
  - Added Kuncheva's consistency index for FS stability evaluation
  - Removed deprecated genetic MRMR-FS
  - Added MakePerformanceLoggable-operator
  
1.0.5
 - Ensemble MRMR can combine rankings
  	-> rankings do not have to be calc'd for all features  
  	-> Combine Ranks, the first 2k features are ranked, when combining ranks, non ranked features receive a penatly rank of 3k
 - Performance-Logger can now log StdDev, variance and number of entries and can now identiy a single criterion by id or name.
 - Top-K-operator can now also return bottom-k and make use of absolute weights
 - LARS - threshold !=0 now delivers an exact solution with |beta|=t and not the best |beta| <= t
 - BUG FIX in RFE: Attributes were removed even when "remove attributes" was not active
 
 1.0.6
  - Now needs RapidMiner 5.1.003 or later!
  - SEVERE BUGFIX: As RapidMiner Bug 437 has been corrected, the sorting direction 
  	for AttributeWeights.sortByWeight(...) have changed. This rendered this plugin 
  	useless with all new version (I guess >= 5.1.x). I adjusted the code to meet these 
  	changes. Sadly, this eliminates downward compatibility. So switch to the latest RM version.  
  	This affects: EnsembleFeatureSelection, ExonWelchTest, RFE, RFE-SVM, Selection2Ranking, 
  	TopK, Weights2Ranking and MRMR-FS.

1.1 (unreleased, but checked in) changes:
  - New operators
    + FCBF - Fast Correlation Based Filter
    + RCCW - Recursive Conditional Correlation Weighting / Selection
    + PAM (Predictive Analysis for Microarrays): Does Prediction and Feature Selection
  - Renamed namespace from "Exons" to "featselext" to fit RapidMiner Marketplace

1.1.1    
 - New operator : BAHSIC - Backward selection via Hilbert-Schmidt information criterion
 - Tuned Welch-test.
 
1.1.2
 - New Operators: t-Test, Test Significance, Benjamini-Hochberg Correction

1.1.3
 - Top-K operator was reworked to behave like "Select by Weights"-operator. 

1.1.4
 - New operators: 
   + BAHSIC : Backward Feature Selection via the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion 
   + DRAGS : Dense Relevant Attribute Group Selector
   + CGS : Consensus Groups Stable Feature Selection
 - PAM operator now returns weights for each class
